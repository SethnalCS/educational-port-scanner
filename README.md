# Educational Port Scanner

## Description
This project demonstrates a basic TCP port scanner designed for educational purposes to understand how network services listen on ports.

## Cybersecurity Relevance
Port scanning is commonly used by security professionals to identify exposed services. Understanding open ports helps reduce attack surfaces and improve system hardening

## Features
- TCP port scanning on localhost
- Configurable port range
- Timeout-based connections
- Safe and ethical design

## Technologies Used
- Python
- socket library

## Ethical Use Notice
This tool is strictly for educational use and should only be used on systems you own or have permission to test. Unauthorized port scanning may be illegal.

## What I Learned
- How TCP connections work at a basic level
- How services listen on ports
- Why exposed ports increase security risk

## Possible Improvements
- Service banner detection
- Threading with rate limiting
- Logging and reporting
